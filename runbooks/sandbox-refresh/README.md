# runbooks/sandbox-refresh

The RUNBOOK files in this folder should explain the manual steps needed after a sandbox has been refreshed. Depending on the type of sandbox, there may be the need to separate the steps into different sandboxes, such as for the ones that contain data (Partial/Full) and the ones that contain purely metadata (Developer/Developer Pro).
