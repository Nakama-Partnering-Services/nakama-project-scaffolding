This folder contains frameworks used in the project. Some frameworks not in the scaffolding but worth to consider based on your project needs are:

- salesforce-plantuml or apex-umlcanvas: to create uml diagrams of sobjects and classes.
- apex-xpath: to let you easily query an XML DOM structure using a simple subset of XPath syntax. For example, for metadata_wsdl.xml or third party integration responses.
- Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS): to perform rollup calculations with lookup fields.
- apex-sobjectdataloader: for exporting and importing records in json format given a list of sobjects record ids.
- apex-toolingapi: wrapper around the tooling api to be used comfortably in apex.
- sfdc-ui-lookup-lwc: a lwc for lookups.
- nakama-related-list: a lwc wrapping a lightning-datatable with standard salesforce related list look and feel and providing configuration options for features such as sorting or inline editing, without additional implementation.
- at4dx or force-di: dependency injection frameworks when extra flexibilty is needed, for example, when working with q managed package and its extensions.
- avonni components or lwc-utils for extra functionalities around lwc components.
