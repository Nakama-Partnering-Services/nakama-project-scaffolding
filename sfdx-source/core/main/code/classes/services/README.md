# sfdx-source/core/main/code/classes/services
This folder is to organize apex classes in the service layer.

Considerations:
- The name of these classes should correspond to the plural name of the SObject they act upon, ending with `Service`. E.g.: `core_AccountsService.cls`.
- These classes should always be `with sharing`, especially when having the global modifier, unless strictly justified and explained in a `// Note: ` comment at the top of the class.
- If Apex logic must access records outside of the userâ€™s visibility, the code must explicitly elevate the execution context as briefly as possible. E.g.: with a private inner `without sharing` class.
- These classes should throw exceptions, or provide partial database handling. E.g.: with `Database.SaveResult`.
- The methods of these classes should be bulkified.
- These classes will just be used by clients.
- Having compound services is better than having clients calling one service after another. Especially good for optimizing SOQL and DML usage.
- Database operations and service state should be encapsulated within the method call to the service layer.
- These classes are the ones that should call `uow.commitWork()`.
- The services should be stateless to give calling contexts the flexibility to employ their own state management solutions.
