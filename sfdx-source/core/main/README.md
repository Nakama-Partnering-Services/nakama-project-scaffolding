# sfdx-source/core/main

This folder is to contain metadata files that provide the main functionality of the project. It will also contain the `default` folder to locate the metadata files to bring locally something that has been created directly in the org, by using `sfdx force:source:retrieve` or `sfdx force:source:pull`. The `default` folder should be added in the `.gitignore` file.
