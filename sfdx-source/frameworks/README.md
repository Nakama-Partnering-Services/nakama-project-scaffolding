This folder contains frameworks used in the project. Some frameworks not in the scaffolding but worth to consider based on your project needs are:

	- salesforce-plantuml or apex-umlcanvas: to create uml diagrams of sobjects and classes.
	- apex-rollup: to perform rollup calculations with lookup fields.
	- apex-sobjectdataloader: for exporting and importing records in json format given a list of sobjects record ids.
	- apex-toolingapi: wrapper around the tooling api to be used comfortably in apex.
	- sfdc-ui-lookup-lwc: a lwc for lookups.
	- sfdc-super-related-list-lwc: a lwc wrapping a lightning-datatable with standard salesforce related list look and feel and providing configuration options for features such as sorting or inline editing, without additional implementation.
	- at4dx or force-di: dependency injection frameworks when extra flexibilty is needed, for example, when working with managed package and extensions.
