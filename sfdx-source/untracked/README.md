# sfdx-source/untracked

This folder is to contain metadata files that git should ignore. Ideally, files in this folder should be added to .gitignore.

For some components (e.g. non-critical reports, email templates) is often better to manage them outside of source control entirely to allow these to be changed dynamically by end users.
